                        A year, numbered \(n\) is defined to be a leap year if \(400\) divides \(n\),
                        or \(4\) divides \(n\) and \(100\) doesn't divide \(n\).
                        Leap years have an extra
                        day, February 29th, which makes them \(366\) days long instead of \(365\).

                        For some reason (that I don't remember), a few days ago while travelling with a friend
                        I started thinking about why these specific rules were chosen, and if there 
                        could potentially be a better set. Unfortunately 
                        this meant that I was totally zoned out of the conversation for a while, and maybe
                        missed out on a bit of Lisbon.
                        This post goes does some reverse engineering that I think it interesting,
                        although take it with a grain of salt because I made a point of doing it from first principles.
                        Here were my conclusions:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, let's recall why leap years exist in the first place.
                        Imagine we are an early humans.
                        From our perspective time is like a continuous number line, and we are a single point on that line,
                        always moving forward.
                        It's not hard to imagine that we would want to develop a language for referring to specific points on this line.
                        For example, we might want to say "I planted this crop at time \(x\)", and the specifics of \(x\)
                        are important to us, to have an idea of when to harvest.
                        The goal is to develop a language for referring to specific points on this line. Let's consider some requirements:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            We want to be able to refer to specific points in time with in absolute terms, that don't change.
                            For example, we don't want a system where events are described as "\(x\) days ago" or "\(y\) days from now",
                            because these descriptions change over time.
                            Otherwise we'd have to remember to update the events we're referring to continuously.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We want our system to be based on easily measurable quantities. This early human 
                            can't measure the vibrations of a quartz crystal, but they can see the sun.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It should be possible to refer to a point with varying levels of granularity. 
                            For example, there's not much difference between "I planted this tree in 54321 BC, Jan. 23, at 1:23pm$,
                            and "I planted this tree in 54321 BC, Jan. 23rd", or even "I planted this tree in 54321 BC", depending on 
                            the context. This is important because people need to remember these points in time, and discarding unnecessary information
                            will make that easier.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It should be accessible and consistent for everyone. 
                            We can't define our calendar in terms of oscillations of a specific pendulum,
                            because most people would never get to see that one pendulum, so they wouldn't know
                            the current time.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Let's think about some units of time that would be available to us as early humans. Obviously it is very 
                        easy to measure time in days, because our environment changes drastically over the course of a day.
                        We are also able to measure time in years, because the climate changes over the course of a year.
                        Also, this one didn't stick in our calendar, but we can measure time in cycles of the moon, by simply observing it.
                        I can't think of any other units that are this consistent, subject to the constraints above.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So naturally, we can use the number of days since a specific point in time to determine the day, and subdivisions of the day, like hours, minutes, and seconds to get more precision.
                        But that isn't sufficient. Nobody can remember the number of days since a specific point in time. 
                        People don't say "I planted this tree on day 738082" (although I think we actually could get used to this system).
                        I think we decided to add years to our calendar because they are a useful quantity to have on hand.
                        Knowing the year, and the position in that year, that the tree was planted on, tells us information
                        like the season, which might be useful to us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is well known that the earth revolves around the sun, and also around itself.
                        As individuals on the surface of the earth, we are deeply affected by both of these astronomical phenomena.
                        The angle of the earths orbit causes our climate to significantly change over the course of each year (seasons),
                        and the earths rotation causes the climate to change significantly over the course of each day (day and night).
                        At some point in our history, we developed a calendar to let us refer to specific points in time, and we decided to use 
                        years and days to do so. Let's consider some requirements:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our goal here is understand why time is indexed by the combination of years and days, so that we can 
                        understand why leap years are defined as they are. But it might help to consider some other possible ways
                        to index time. First, let's consider some requirements:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Counting time in days is an obvious choice. First, 


                        They exist because 
                        a year doesn't have exactly \(365\) days in it - it has approximately \(365.2437\dots\).
                        It's not surprising that the length of a day doesn't cleanly divide the length of a year,
                        given that these quantities are not really linked by any physical phenomena, 
                        the chance that one would be an integer multiple of the other is very low.
                        The issue is that we want our calendars to represent points in time using both days and years,
                        because they are both easily measurable quantities from the perspective of a human, and they are useful 
                        in our day to day lives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The simplest solution would be to just round down the number of days in a year to \(365\).
                        Then our calendar can say a year is every \(365\) days, which is approximately true.
                        But each year would be \(0.2437\dots\) days too short, which over time would accumulate,
                        and after a few hundred years the seasons would completely flip.
