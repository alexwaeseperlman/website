                    Let \(N\) be a random variable representing the number of children that a family has.
                    The probability mass function of \(N\) is given by
                    \[
                        \mathbb{P}(N=k) = \begin{cases}
                            1 - \alpha\frac{p}{1-p} & \text{if } k = 0 \\
                            \alpha p^k & \text{if } k = 1 \\
                        \end{cases}
                    \]
                    The problem tells us that each child has probability \(\frac{1}{2}\) of being a girl,
                    and asks us to find the probability mass function of \(G\), the number
                    of girls the family has.

                    <p>
                        I had a few different approaches to this problem, and I find it interesting 
                        that they all lead to the same solution. The solution given to us by the professor
                        is the first one I'll present, and while it's probably the most easy to come up with,
                        it doesn't give much insight into the problem. Also, approach \(3\) will shock and amaze you.

                    <p>
                        The point of this post is to help build
                        intuition on conditional probability and generating functions.
                        I guess the target audience would be to people who already have taken a probability course,
                        and know what conditional probability and generating functions are.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Approach 1: Summing a series</h2>
                    <p>
                        The only information we are given is the probability of the family having \(k\) children,
                        for all \(k\), and that each child has a probability of \(\frac{1}{2}\) of being
                        a girl. This leads to the simple observation that given \(N = k\),
                        \(G\) is binomially distributed with parameters \(k\) and \(\frac{1}{2}\).
                        In other words,
                        \[
                            \mathbb{P}(G = g | N = k) = \binom{k}{g} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^g \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right)^{k-g} = \binom{k}{g} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k
                        \]
                        So by the law of total probability, if \(g \geq 1\) then
                        \begin{align*}
                            \mathbb{P}(G = g) &= \sum_{k=g}^\infty \mathbb{P}(G = g | N = k) \mathbb{P}(N = k)\\
                            &= \sum_{k=g}^\infty \binom{k}{g} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k \alpha p^k\\
                            &= \alpha \sum_{k=g}^\infty \binom{k}{g} \left(\frac{p}{2}\right)^k
                        \end{align*}
                        Here, whoever was writing the solution pulled the following identity out of their hat (apparently GitHub 
                        copilot also knows this identity):
                        \[
                            \sum_{k=g}^\infty \binom{k}{g} x^k = \frac{x^g}{(1-x)^{g+1}}
                        \]
                        I'll give some proofs of this at the end of this page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With this identity the rest of the problem is easy:
                        Simply apply it, with \(x = \frac{p}{2}\), to get
                        \[
                            \mathbb{P}(G = g) = \alpha \frac{\left(\frac{p}{2}\right)^g}{\left(1 - \frac{p}{2}\right)^{g+1}}
                        \]
                        Now we just need to handle the case where \(g = 0\). We use the same sum, which this time is a geometric series:
                        \begin{align*}
                            \mathbb{P}(G = 0) &= \sum_{k=0}^\infty \binom{k}{0} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k \mathbb{P}(N = k) \\
                            &= \sum_{k=0}^\infty \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k\mathbb{P}(N = k) \\
                            &= 1 - \alpha \frac{p}{1-p} + \sum_{k=1}^\infty \alpha \left(\frac{p}{2}\right)^k \\
                            &= 1 - \alpha \frac{p}{1-p} + \alpha \frac{\frac{p}{2}}{1 - \frac{p}{2}}\\
                            &= 1 - \alpha\frac{p}{(1-p)(2-p)}
                        \end{align*}
                        And now we know the probability for all values of \(g\).
                    </p>
                    <h2>Approach 2: Understanding the problem</h2>
                    <p>
                        Approach 2 is to look at the distribution, try to understand what's going on intuitively, and then make that formal.
                        It is much more error prone because making ad-hoc observations can lead to mistakes, but maybe we'll learn something.
                        Also this writeup is longer than it needs to be, but the idea is to build intuition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first thing we notice is that this distribution looks somewhat like an geometric distribution.
                        The question is, what similarities does it have to a sequence of weighted coin flips?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Notice that 
                        \begin{align*}
                            \mathbb{P}(N = k|N\geq 1) &= \frac{\mathbb{P}(N = k)}{1 - \mathbb{P}(N = 0)}\\
                                &= \frac{\alpha p^k}{\alpha\frac{p}{1-p}}\\
                                &= p^{k-1}(1-p)
                        \end{align*}
                        This is exactly the probability of getting \(k-1\) heads in a row, followed by a tails,
                        where the probability of heads is \(p\).
                        Or in the context of this problem, we can say that after each child, the family has a probability \(p\) of having another child,
                        and probability \(1-p\) of stopping having children.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But this distribution isn't a geometric distribution, so clearly the first child is different from the rest.
                        This is what the parameter \(\alpha\) is for. The probability of having a first child is 
                        \[
                            \mathbb{P}(N \geq 1) = 1 - \mathbb{P}(N = 0) = \alpha\frac{p}{1-p}
                        \]
                        and the probability of having each subsequent child is \(p\).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It becomes slightly easier to think about if we make all of the children equal. We can split the \(\mathbb{P}(N = 0)\) case 
                        into two events for which \(N\) is still \(0\).
                        Instead of having the first child be different, we say that the family first makes the decision to <i>start</i> having children,
                        and then each child is born with probability \(p\). Call the event that they start having children \(S\).
                        Since \(\mathbb{P}(N \geq 1) = \frac{\alpha p}{1-p}\), and \(\mathbb{P}(N \geq 1 | S)\) should be \(p\) 
                        we can say that \(\mathbb{P}(S) = \frac{\alpha}{1-p}\).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now note that in the context of this problem there are actually \(3\) possible outcomes for each child: 
                        the family has a boy, the family has a girl, or the family stops having children.
                        This is like a weighted dice-roll with three outcomes.
                        The first two outcomes happen with probability \(\frac{p}{2}\) each, and the last happens with probability \(1 - p\).
                        To find the probability mass function of \(G\), the key observation to determine the probability mass function of \(G\) 
                        is that we <i>don't care</i> about children 
                        that are boys. If the family has a boy, we just ignore them and move on to the next child.
                        In other words, we can condition the roll on the fact that it was not a boy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then, the probability that the family has girl given that they are having children is
                        \begin{align*}
                            \mathbb{P}(G \geq k+1 | G\geq k,S) &= \mathbb{P}(\text{The next child is a girl}|\text{The next child is not a boy})\\
                            &= \frac{\frac{p}{2}}{1 - \frac{p}{2}}\\
                        \end{align*}
                        So by the same logic as the geometric distribution,
                        \begin{align*}
                            \mathbb{P}(G = k | S) &= \left(\frac{\frac{p}{2}}{1-\frac{p}{2}}\right)^k\left(1 - \frac{\frac{p}{2}}{1-\frac{p}{2}}\right)\\
                            &= \frac{\left(\frac{p}{2}\right)^k}{\left(1 - \frac{p}{2}\right)^{k}}\frac{1-p}{1 - \frac{p}{2}}\\
                            &= \frac{\left(\frac{p}{2}\right)^k}{\left(1 - \frac{p}{2}\right)^{k+1}}\left(1-p\right)
                        \end{align*}
                        So for \(k \geq 1\),
                        \begin{align*}
                            \mathbb{P}(G = k) &= \mathbb{P}(G = k | S)\mathbb{P}(S)\\
                            &= \frac{\alpha}{1-p}\frac{\left(\frac{p}{2}\right)^k}{\left(1 - \frac{p}{2}\right)^{k+1}}\left(1-p\right)\\
                            &= \alpha\frac{\left(\frac{p}{2}\right)^k}{\left(1 - \frac{p}{2}\right)^{k+1}}
                        \end{align*}
                        And for \(k = 0\),
                        \begin{align*}
                            \mathbb{P}(G = 0) &= \mathbb{P}(G = 0 | S)\mathbb{P}(S) + \mathbb{P}(\neg S)\\
                            &= \frac{\alpha}{1-p}\frac{1-p}{1 - \frac{p}{2}} + 1 - \frac{\alpha}{1-p}\\
                            &= 1 - \alpha\frac{p}{(1-p)(2-p)}
                        \end{align*}
                    </p>
                    <h2>Approach 3: Generating functions magic</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm not going to try that hard to formalize this because I don't know why it works, but it's cool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The probability generating function of \(N\) is defined as the power series, where its exponents are the possible values of \(N\),
                        and its coefficients are the probabilities of those values.
                        So
                        \begin{align*}
                            g_N(x) &= \sum_{k=0}^\infty \mathbb{P}(N = k)x^k\\
                            &= 1 - \alpha\frac{p}{1-p} + \sum_{k=1}^\infty \alpha p^k x^k\\
                            &= 1 - \alpha\frac{p}{1-p} + \alpha \frac{px}{1 - px}
                        \end{align*}
                        The idea here is that if we take the coefficient of \(x^k\) in \(g_N(x)\), we get \(\mathbb{P}(N = k)\).
                        One way to think of it is that each \(x^k\) term in the series corresponds to \(k\) copies of \(x\),
                        and that the initial distribution is \(g_N(\textbf{child})\) (meaning \(x\) is substituted for a child),
                        which becomes a super-position of various numbers of children.
                        Another way to think of it is that the series is a super-position of the possible values of \(N\),
                        which are integers, which makes the series an element of the group ring of \(\mathbb{Z}\) (just ignore this sentence
                        if it didn't make sense).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All of that nonsense is to justify what I'm about to do: if \(g_N(\textbf{child})\) is a super position 
                        of the possible numbers of children, we can instead put \(\frac{1}{2}\textbf{boy} + \frac{1}{2}\textbf{girl}\) in for a child
                        (a super-position with one half probability of being a boy, and one half probability of being a girl).
                        Now we get 
                        \[
                            g_N\left(\frac{1}{2}\textbf{boy} + \frac{1}{2}\textbf{girl}\right) = 1 - \alpha\frac{p}{1-p} + 
                            \alpha \frac{p\left(\frac{1}{2}\textbf{boy} + \frac{1}{2}\textbf{girl}\right)}{1 - p\left(\frac{1}{2}\textbf{boy} + \frac{1}{2}\textbf{girl}\right)}
                        \]
                        Now to get \(\mathbb{P}(G = k)\), we just need to take the coefficient
                        of \(\textbf{girl}^k\) in this expression. And we can do this by finding the constant term of \(k\)th derivative of the expression
                        with respect to \(\textbf{girl}\) (and dividing by \(k!\) to get rid of the power rule factors). 
                        Note that we are kind of just abusing the fact that there is a nice algorithm
                        for finding derivatives, and \(\textbf{girl}\) is not really a continuous variable, but it works. Also note that
                        \(\textbf{boy}\) is a constant with respect to \(\textbf{girl}\), so we can just replace it with \(\textbf{girl}^0=1\) (because
                        a boy is \(0\) girls). Also let's let \(x = \textbf{girl}\) for simplicity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So we want to find
                        \begin{align*}
                            \frac{d^k}{dx^k}\frac{g_N\left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}x\right)}{k!} &= 
                            \frac{d^k}{dx^k}\frac{1 - \alpha\frac{p}{1-p} + \alpha \frac{p\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}x\right)}{1 - p\left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}x\right)}}{k!}\\
                        \end{align*}
                        and evaluate it at \(x = 0\) to get the constant term.
                        This function has some weird constant terms, so let's handle the \(\mathbb{P}(G = 0)\) case first:
                        \begin{align*}
                            \frac{d^0}{dx^0}_{x=0}g_N\left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}x\right) &= g_N\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\\
                            &= 1 - \alpha\frac{p}{1-p} + \alpha \frac{p\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}{1 - p\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}\\
                            &= 1 - \alpha\frac{p}{(1-p)(2-p)}
                        \end{align*}

                        Now we can find the other terms:
                        \begin{align*}
                            \frac{1}{k!}\frac{d^k}{dx^k}g_N\left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}x\right) &= 
                            \frac{1}{k!}
                                \frac{d^k}{dx^k}\left(1 - \alpha\frac{p}{1-p} + \alpha \frac{p\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}x\right)}{1 -
                                p\left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}x\right)}\right)\\
                                &= \frac{1}{k!}
                                \frac{d^k}{dx^k}\left(\alpha \frac{p\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}x\right)}{1 -
                                p\left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}x\right)}\right)\\
                                &= \frac{1}{k!}
                                \alpha\frac{d^k}{dx^k}\left(\frac{1}{1 -
                                p\left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}x\right)}-1\right)\\
                                &= \frac{1}{k!}
                                \alpha\frac{d^k}{dx^k}\left(\frac{1}{1 -
                                p\left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}x\right)}\right)\\
                                &= \frac{1}{k!}
                                \alpha\frac{d^k}{dx^k}\left(1 -
                                p\left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}x\right)\right)^{-1}\\
                                &= 
                                \alpha\left(1 -
                                p\left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}x\right)\right)^{-(k+1)}\left(\frac{p}{2}\right)^k\\
                        \end{align*}
                        Subbing \(x=0\), we see our familiar expression:
                        \begin{align*}
                            \frac{1}{k!}\frac{d^k}{dx^k}_{x=0}g_N\left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}x\right) &=
                            \alpha\left(1 -
                            p\frac{1}{2}\right)^{-(k+1)}\left(\frac{p}{2}\right)^k\\
                            &= \alpha\frac{\left(\frac{p}{2}\right)^k}{\left(1 - \frac{p}{2}\right)^{k+1}}
                        \end{align*}
                        So somehow this approach also gives the same answer.

                    <h2>Appendix: Proofs of the sum from approach 1</h2>
                    <p>
                        I had two ideas for a proof of the sum, so I guess we're continuing the theme of having different solutions.

                    <h3>Proof 1: Hockey stick identity</h3>
                    <p>
                        We have the sum 
                        \begin{align*}
                            S_g = \sum_{k=g}^\infty \binom{k}{g} x^k
                        \end{align*}
                        The hockey stick identity states that
                        \[
                            \sum_{\ell=g}^{k-1} \binom{\ell}{g-1} = \binom{k}{g}
                        \]
                        So we can rewrite the sum as
                        \begin{align*}
                            S_g = \sum_{k=g}^\infty \sum_{\ell=g-1}^{k-1} \binom{\ell}{g-1} x^k &= \sum_{\ell=g-1}^\infty \sum_{k=\ell+1}^\infty \binom{\ell}{g-1} x^k\\
                            &= \sum_{\ell=g-1}^\infty\binom{\ell}{g-1} \sum_{k=\ell+1}^\infty x^k\\
                            &= \sum_{\ell=g-1}^\infty\binom{\ell}{g-1} \frac{x^{\ell+1}}{1-x}\\
                            &= \frac{x}{1-x}\sum_{\ell=g-1}^\infty\binom{\ell}{g-1} x^\ell\\
                            &= \frac{x}{1-x}S_{g-1}
                        \end{align*}
                        And 
                        \begin{align*}
                            S_0 = \sum_{k=0}^\infty x^k = \frac{1}{1-x}
                        \end{align*}
                        So 
                        \[
                            S_g = x^g\left(1-x\right)^{-(g+1)}
                        \]
                    </p>
                    <h3>Proof 2: Negative binomial coefficients</h3>
                    <p>
                        \begin{align*}
                            S_g = \sum_{k=g}^\infty \binom{k}{g} x^k &= \sum_{k=g}^\infty \frac{k!}{g!(k-g)!}x^k\\
                            &= \frac{x^g}{g!} \sum_{k=g}^\infty \frac{k!}{(k-g)!}x^{k-g}\\
                        \end{align*}
                        Now, remembering power rule, observe that the \(g\)th derivative of \(x^k\) is \(k(k-1)\cdots(k-g+1)x^{k-g}\).
                        This is the same as the term in our sum, so
                        \begin{align*}
                            S_g &= \frac{x^g}{g!} \sum_{k=g}^\infty \frac{k!}{(k-g)!}x^{k-g}\\
                            &= \frac{x^g}{g!} \sum_{k=g}^\infty \frac{d^g}{dx^g}x^k\\
                            &= \frac{x^g}{g!} \frac{d^g}{dx^g}\sum_{k=g}^\infty x^k\\
                            &= \frac{x^g}{g!} \frac{d^g}{dx^g}\sum_{k=0}^\infty x^k\\
                            &= \frac{x^g}{g!} \frac{d^g}{dx^g}\frac{1}{1-x}\\
                            &= \frac{x^g}{g!} \frac{g!}{(1-x)^{g+1}}\\
                            &= \frac{x^g}{(1-x)^{g+1}}
                        \end{align*}
                        Note that we could extend the sum to go start from zero because the \(g\)th derivative of \(x^n\) is zero for \(n < g\).
