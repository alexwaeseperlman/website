                        Almost two years ago, the McGill competitive programming club, Compute McGill
                        (formerly Compete McGill), had the idea to host a drinking and programming contest,
                        inspired by <a href="https://youtu.be/uxKmDWDUZ5A?si=GCxw2ROAAubmG4Be">the drinking 
                        game from the movie "The Social Network"</a>.
                        One of our execs came up with the very clever idea to name it "FizzBuzzed",
                        a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz">the programming
                        problem "FizzBuzz"</a>, a common interview question.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since then, we've hosted the event four times, and learned a lot from each attempt.
                        Each iteration had slightly different rules, and the most recent one was the most
                        successful by far. I am about to graduate which means that I won't be around to continue
                        hosting events like this, so I thought it would be useful to write a post about the lessons we learned,
                        so that future generations can avoid some of the pitfalls that we ran into. Hopefully this will even be
                        helpful to clubs at other universities as well!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also, I want to say that I don't condone binge drinking. It's important to host events
                        that are safe and fun for everyone. Bar tenders are trained to spot people who are too drunk
                        and refuse service to anyone who is too intoxicated. We also made sure people understood that 
                        they could stop drinking at any point, and brought some snacks to help people sober up.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        First, let's talk about the rules. For each event, the general structure was the same:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The event is split into some number of rounds of increasing difficulty.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Before each round, participants are given a drink (sometimes shots and sometimes beer).
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        The variables that differed between events were:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Total number of problems, their style, and their difficulty.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Total number of drinks, and how they were distributed.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Team sizes.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The venue and problem platform.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        Below is an analysis of each event.
                    </p>
                    <h2>FizzBuzzed 1.0</h2>
                    <p>
                        The first attempt had around 20 participants (participating solo), and we hosted it in
                        Tipsy Cow, a bar near McGill. In it we realized that first, getting the problem setting right is crucial to 
                        the success of the event, and second, getting the problem setting right is extremely difficult. 
                        The structure was made up of 6 rounds of one problem each. Each competitor was given a shot after each round, except
                        for the last, and they were allowed to skip the shot after one round of their choice. This meant that people were drinking 
                        4 shots over the course of the event. Also, the overall structure was like a race, as in you had 
                        to finish a round before you could start the next one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The exec who set the problems said that his goal was basically to 
                        set problems that would be challenging to the ICPC team.
                        I still remember one of the last problems
                        <a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems/fakescoreboard">from the contest</a>,
                        which had us finding a lexicographically minimal flow in a graph, requiring us to implement a modified flow algorithm,
                        while drunk (obviously no one solved it). I think several people solved none, or only one problem,
                        which was very frustrating for them, and was exacerbated by the fact that 
                        you couldn't even attempt the next problem until you finished the current one. 
                        Overall the feedback from this event was pretty negative,
                        and it was a bit embarrassing, but we still had a vision so we decided to try again.
                    </p>
                    <h2>FizzBuzzed 2.0</h2>
                    <p>
                        The second attempt was similar. Also solo, and held at Tipsy Cow, 
                        although I think with fewer people (around 15 I think?).
                        I think the problems were a bit more balanced. This time we added a system for skipping problems.
                        If I remember correctly the deal was you could roll a 6-sided die, and if you rolled a 6 you could skip a problem,
                        but for any other number you had to do 10 times that many pushups. Also I think people were able to solve 
                        problems out of order this time, meaning they weren't separated into rounds.
                        This meant that even if you didn't know how to solve a problem, you could still
                        move on to the next one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This solved a lot of the issues from the first event, and overall the feedback was more positive, but there were still some
                        issues. The biggest one was that the problems were still too hard. Ideally, the problems should be such that
                        everyone solves a few of them, and most people solve all of them. Also, 4 shots is a lot, 
                        but somehow it wasn't enough to get that feeling of solving problems in increasing levels of <em>impairment</em>.
                        Maybe this was because the contest was moving too fast, so the shots weren't really kicking in before attempting 
                        the next problem, or maybe it just wasn't enough alcohol. And last, I don't think we realized it at the time,
                        but it wasn't social enough. Part of the fun should be the excitement of solving problems together,
                        and cheering people on, but we didn't really have that.
                    </p>
                    <h2>FizzBuzzed "Fizz" (3.0)</h2>
                    <p>
                        The third attempt was a bit more casual. One of our former execs,
                        had graduated and his roommates had moved out, so he
                        had his apartment to himself. He offered to host the event there, and we tried it.
                        Although this time it was mostly just our friends. I think around 10 people participated.
                        He had a couple new ideas: instead of 6 individual problems, there were 3 rounds of 2 problems each.
                        The structure was like a race again, where people start rounds individually, 
                        but you could solve the problems within a round in any order you wanted.
                        Also, instead of shots, we split the drinks into 3 beers and 3 shots.
                        Before each round, you drank a shot, and you received a beer to drink during the round (which 
                        should be finished before you start the next round).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was way more fun than the first two for a few reasons. First, it ended up being a lot more social.
                        I think this is because people felt more comfortable talking to each other in a more casual setting. 
                        Also, the addition of the beer made the event more fun, and
                        the fact that people drank more made the end more chaotic and fun.
                        Here we finally got to experience that feeling of debugging code while drunk, which is truly a unique experience.
                        The only real issues were that the end was pretty disorganized, so there isn't a clear winner (people were just
                        working together on the problems, which was actually really fun), and I accidentally set a problem that was too hard,
                        although one person solved it eventually.
                    </p>
                    <h2>FizzBuzzed 4.0</h2>
                    <p>
                        The fourth attempt was unique, since this time we hosted it in collaboration with ECSESS,
                        an organization for engineering students at McGill. We hosted it at
                        Bar Milton-Parc, a different bar near McGill which had a vibe that fit the event better.
                        This time we tried to formalize the social aspect of the event, by having people compete in teams of 2. Some people 
                        even came with more than 2.
                        This time we made the problems much easier. 
                        We still had 3 rounds of 2, with the shots and beers, but now each round had a specified
                        start time, so it was not a race. You would just get your drinks at the start of each round, and then solve as 
                        many problems as you could.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was also our most popular round, with over 30 people participating. We hosted it on vjudge and I still have the
                        problems since it was recent. Here are the contest links (these are all existing problems,
                        but I rewrote the problem statements to make them fit the theme):
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <a href="https://vjudge.net/contest/701284">Round 1</a>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <a href="https://vjudge.net/contest/701287">Round 2</a>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <a href="https://vjudge.net/contest/701291">Round 3</a>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <a href="https://vjudge.net/contest/701313">Bonus problem (I added a bonus during the contest after there was an issue in a problem in round 2)</a>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        Before setting these problems I had a hypothesis that the best problems would be ones that focus on implementation,
                        since it's hard to be clever while drunk. After talking to the contestants though,
                        there didn't seem to be a strong preference for any particular style of problem.
                        One thing I think is important is that they should never require book code (prewritten algorithms),
                        and ideally they should require minimal knowledge of the 'meta'.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Vjudge is a platform for making contests out of problems that are hosted on various competitive programming sites,
                        and it's mostly great, but it ended up causing us some problems. For one, it's hard to get people to register -
                        they don't support external logins, so people had to create an account just to participate. Also,
                        in order to submit to problems hosted on kattis, people have to manually add their kattis session token to the vjudge account,
                        which a lot of people didn't know how to do, so I had to go around helping them. Last, it seems like for some 
                        codeforces problems, but not all, you also have to manually add your codeforces session token. If you are going to
                        use vjudge, I recommend testing every problem with a fresh account, and taking note of exactly what you needed to do
                        to submit to each problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think the only real issue with FizzBuzzed 4.0 was that people had some issues using vjudge. In previous contests
                        we had used kattis, but vjudge is nicer because it lets you host problems from other sites, and it lets 
                        you rewrite the problem statements. We also had some trouble getting drinks to everyone on time while they were coding,
                        which meant that people weren't taking shots at the same time. 
                        For the future it would be fun to do a group shot right before each 
                        round starts, and have everyone ready to go at once with beers.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        The goal of this post was to share all the information we learned, so that FizzBuzzed can continue to evolve.
                        I think that hosting these gimmicky competitive programming events is a great way to build a community
                        and get people excited about learning, but I also think that they tend to be a lot harder
                        to organize than your average university social event or even hackathon. You have to manage a lot of things,
                        like problem setting, the technical infrastructure around judging, and making sure everyone has a computer, 
                        all in addition to the standard social event stuff like finding a venue, advertising, etc.
                        All of that being said, I think the effort pays off, and it's a lot of fun to host and take part in.
